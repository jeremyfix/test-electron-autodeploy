# What is that ?

This is a test repository I used for experimenting the auto deployment of a basic electron app to create, with electron-builder, the bundles for the different platforms (win32, macos, linux).

Building of the app is done with the CI services integrated with github, especially Travis CI.

## Testing the app

For testing the app, you simply :

	cd app
	yarn
	yarn start

The app has been developed following the book "Electron project: build over 9 cross-platform desktop applications from scratch"
